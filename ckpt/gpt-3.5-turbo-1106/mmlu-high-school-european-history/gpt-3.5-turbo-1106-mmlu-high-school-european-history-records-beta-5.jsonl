Answer: A \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nAlbeit the king's Majesty justly and rightfully is and ought to be the supreme head of the Church of England, and so is recognized by the clergy of this realm in their convocations, yet nevertheless, for corroboration and confirmation thereof, and for increase of virtue in Christ's religion within this realm of England, and to repress and extirpate all errors, heresies, and other enormities and abuses heretofore used in the same, be it enacted, by authority of this present Parliament, that the king, our sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme head in earth of the Church of England, called Anglicans Ecclesia; and shall have and enjoy, annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm, as well the title and style thereof, as all honors, dignities, preeminences, jurisdictions, privileges, authorities, immunities, profits, and commodities to the said dignity of the supreme head of the same Church belonging and appertaining; and that our said sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall have full power and authority from time to time to visit, repress, redress, record, order, correct, restrain, and amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts, and enormities, whatsoever they be, which by any manner of spiritual authority or jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed, repressed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended, most to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of virtue in Christ's religion, and for the conservation of the peace, unity, and tranquility of this realm; any usage, foreign land, foreign authority, prescription, or any other thing or things to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.\nEnglish Parliament, Act of Supremacy, 1534\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the English Parliament wished to argue that the Act of Supremacy would A. give the English king a new position of authority B. give the position of head of the Church of England to Henry VIII alone and exclude his heirs C. establish Calvinism as the one true theology in England D. end various forms of corruption plaguing the Church in England? Answer: D \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following memoir.\nNot only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?

He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason.

Answer: B \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above? A. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe. B. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power. C. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur. D.

Answer: A \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?

Answer: B \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?

Answer: A \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above? A. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe. B. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power. C.

Answer: A \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received.

You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one may say that Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos was based on", "user_prompt": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school european history. \nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine.

Answer: D \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nFirst we must remark that the cosmos is spherical in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one may say that Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos was based on A. observation and induction B. ancient textual authority C. experimentation D. deduction from first principles?

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following motives for exploration is de las Casas most likely to think is most important in Source 2?

As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences.\nXIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.\nXXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&\u2026\nXXXVI.

Answer: B \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?

They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering.

He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&\u2026.\nOne day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&\u2026.She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&\u2026.We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.\"\nVoltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759\nCandide's statement that \"everything always happens for the best\" can be seen as a reflection of the Enlightenment belief that A. society can be perfected if you apply the scientific method to it B. a people without a strong central authority are doomed to live in a state of nature C. the only purpose of a government is to secure the rights of life, liberty, and property D. only free markets can lead nations to wealth and happiness?

He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of.

Answer: B \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?

Answer: A \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?

A. They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century. B. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended. C. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war. D.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.

A. They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century. B. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended. C.

Answer: A \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nAlbeit the king's Majesty justly and rightfully is and ought to be the supreme head of the Church of England, and so is recognized by the clergy of this realm in their convocations, yet nevertheless, for corroboration and confirmation thereof, and for increase of virtue in Christ's religion within this realm of England, and to repress and extirpate all errors, heresies, and other enormities and abuses heretofore used in the same, be it enacted, by authority of this present Parliament, that the king, our sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme head in earth of the Church of England, called Anglicans Ecclesia; and shall have and enjoy, annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm, as well the title and style thereof, as all honors, dignities, preeminences, jurisdictions, privileges, authorities, immunities, profits, and commodities to the said dignity of the supreme head of the same Church belonging and appertaining; and that our said sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall have full power and authority from time to time to visit, repress, redress, record, order, correct, restrain, and amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts, and enormities, whatsoever they be, which by any manner of spiritual authority or jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed, repressed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended, most to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of virtue in Christ's religion, and for the conservation of the peace, unity, and tranquility of this realm; any usage, foreign land, foreign authority, prescription, or any other thing or things to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.\nEnglish Parliament, Act of Supremacy, 1534\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the English Parliament wished to argue that the Act of Supremacy would A. give the English king a new position of authority B. give the position of head of the Church of England to Henry VIII alone and exclude his heirs C. establish Calvinism as the one true theology in England D. end various forms of corruption plaguing the Church in England? Answer: D \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following quote.\nI had now decided beyond all question that there existed in the heavens three stars wandering about Jupiter as do Venus and Mercury about the sun, and this became plainer than daylight from observations on similar occasions which followed. Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following Polish thinkers was most likely the person whose ideas convinced Galileo to have written the statement above?

He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power? A. Jean Jacques Rousseau B. Baron Montesquieu C. Mary Wollstonecraft D. Adam Smith? Answer: B \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above? A. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe. B. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power. C. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur. D. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.? Answer: A \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement? A. Capitalist B. Scientific C. Communist D. Existentialist?

A. They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century. B. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended. C. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war. D. They led to nearly a century of recurrent war between England and the Netherlands, which would not end until after American independence.?

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nThe type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to what Southern Renaissance movement?", "user_prompt": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school european history. \nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine.

Answer: D \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nThe type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to what Southern Renaissance movement?

Some of which were then but new discoveries, and others not so generally known and embraced, as now they are. \u2026\nWe barred all discourses of divinity, of state affairs, and of news, other than what concerned our business of Philosophy. These meetings we removed soon after to the Bull Head in Cheapside, and in term-time to Gresham College, where we met weekly at Mr. Foster's lecture (then Astronomy Professor there), and, after the lecture ended, repaired, sometimes to Mr. Foster's lodgings, sometimes to some other place not far distant, where we continued such enquiries, and our numbers increased.\nDr. John Wallis, Account of Some Passages of his Life, 1700\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the main interest of Wallis's group was A. undermining of the traditional worldview B. creating of a secular science to challenge the Church C. ascertaining the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad D. the regulation of new knowledge so as not to undermine traditional values?

Answer: B \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?

Answer: A \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything!

You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?

The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.\n\u2014John S. C.

So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nThe passage may be used as evidence that Copernicus differed from the traditional, Aristotelian natural philosophers of his day because he suggested that", "user_prompt": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school european history. \nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine.

Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nThe passage may be used as evidence that Copernicus differed from the traditional, Aristotelian natural philosophers of his day because he suggested that A. the cosmos is spherical B. the Earth is spherical C. the cosmos is geostatic D. the Earth is not stationary?

Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one could argue that Copernicus was working in A. the Aristotelian tradition B. the natural magic tradition C. the skeptical tradition D. the Platonic/Pythagorean tradition?

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy.

Answer: D \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Italian nation has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A. Freeman, British historian and politician, The Chief Periods of European History, 1885\nAccording to the author, Italy's connections to its history and traditions were most \"fully snapped\" when A.

Answer: D \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following memoir.\nNot only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following was the greatest weakness and regret of the rule of King Louis XIV?

Answer: B \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?

Answer: A \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery!

Answer: D \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following quote.\nI had now decided beyond all question that there existed in the heavens three stars wandering about Jupiter as do Venus and Mercury about the sun, and this became plainer than daylight from observations on similar occasions which followed. Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following is best demonstrated by the passage about intellectual thought at the time?

Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?

Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I.

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above? A. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe. B. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power. C.

Answer: A \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?

A. They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century. B. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended. C. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war. D.

He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&\u2026.\nOne day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&\u2026.She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&\u2026.We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.\"\nVoltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759\nThe critiques offered by Voltaire through Candide are most closely shared by what other philosopher?

In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n\u2014John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following religions that started around the same time as Calvinism was destroyed for supporting adult baptism and pacifism?

I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron.

They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?

Answer: D \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nHuizinga's apparent support of Erasmus' belief in the \"book of antiquity\" being \"open to all\" is most likely a product of A. the author's life as a member of twentieth-century Europe, which prized such characteristics B. the longevity of Erasmus' works C. the Dutch reverence for the works of Erasmus D. the typical unflinching support of one philosopher for another philosopher's work?

Answer: B \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?

He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common.

Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

A. They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century. B.

They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement? A. Capitalist B. Scientific C. Communist D. Existentialist?

It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nMarx and Engels would be most inclined to view which of the following developments as a significant event in European history?

Answer: B \n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?

If I remain longer doing nothing, I am lost. In this great Babylon one reputation quickly succeeds another. After I have been seen three times at the theatre, I shall not be looked at again. I shall therefore not go very frequently. (diary, 1798)\nIf the press is not bridled, I shall not remain three days in power. (diary, 1799)\nThe presence of a general is necessary; he is the head, he is the all in all of an army. It was not the Roman army that conquered Gaul, it was Caesar, it was not the Carthaginians that made the armies of the Roman republic tremble at the very gates of Rome, it was Hannibal. (diary, 1801)\nMy power proceeds from my reputation, and my reputation from the victories I have won. My power would fall if I were not to support it with more glory and more victories. Conquest has made me what I am; only conquest can maintain me. (diary, 1802)\nThe revolution in France is over and now there is only one party in France and I shall never allow the newspapers to say anything contrary to my interests. They may publish a few little articles with just a bit of poison in them, but one fine day I shall shut their mouths forever.

Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following conclusions drawn in part from the observations above was the most revolutionary over time?

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte.

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?

He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering.

These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.
